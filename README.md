## Introduction

**This repository contains a library of functions, a sample driver for a family of microcontrollers, and demonstration code for transferring data to a host over a serial channel.** 
The RTEcomLib library is part of the RTEdbg toolkit. See the **[RTEdbg main repository](https://github.com/RTEdbg/RTEdbg)** for the complete toolkit description and links to documentation and other repositories.

The code in this repository demonstrates how to transfer data logged with the RTEdbg library to the host over a serial channel. The demo shows how to transfer data between the embedded system and the host over a two-wire and a single-wire (half-duplex) connection. Single-wire communication is especially useful for microcontrollers with a very limited number of pins or where almost all pins are busy.

Serial data transfer can also be used if transfers with the RTEgdbData utility in parallel with the IDE's built-in debugger are not possible, or if it would limit the functionality of debugging (e.g. if it would be necessary to disable the Live View functionality).

The programmer must initialize the serial peripheral with the selected baud rate and the following parameters:

* Number of bits: 8
* Parity: none, odd or even
* Stop bits: 1

Data transfer to the host is possible with the **[RTEcomData](https://github.com/RTEdbg/RTEcomData)** utility.

In the demo code, the focus is on displaying the data transfer rather than logging. The firmware only logs the following events
- Type of reset after reset (power-on, watch-dog, from NRST pin, ...)
- Periodic watchdog update (IWDG)
- Start of the interrupt program EXTI4_15_IRQHandler() communicated by key B1 (blue key on the demo board)

This code is also a demonstration that logging continues normally after a system reset - e.g. watchdog, reset with key B1 (black key on the demo board). The watchdog reset occurs after about 16 seconds, because the IWDG counter is no longer refreshed after 10 seconds.

The source code for the data transfer functions in the RTEcomLib folder - see the serial communication library [Readme](./RTEcomLib/Readme.md) for details.

### Communicating in a Noisy Environment
If serial communication is used in an electrically noisy environment, the following measures should be taken:
1. Keep the connection to the host as short as possible, use twisted and/or shielded cable, filtering, etc.
2. Enable parity on the serial link.
3. Implement the timeout for data reception in the embedded system (see the implementation in the main.c demo file).

When the host and the embedded system get out of sync, the host data transfer utility should send either a BREAK sequence of bits or 10 consecutive characters with a value greater than RTECOM_LAST_COMMAND (e.g. 0xFF).
<br> Note: If a BREAK character is received, the USART will treat it as a framing error.

### How to test the two-wire or single-wire communication on the NUCLEO-C071RB demo board

The default setup enables two-wire communication. The ST-LINK v2 integrated on the NUCLEO PCB enables a serial communication (VCP of the ST-LINK). Nothing has to be done for a two-wire test. The RTECOM_SINGLE_WIRE compile time parameter has to be set to 0 to enable single-wire communication. The following modifications have to be done 
on the NUCLEO-C071RB also:
1. Connect one side of the 1k0 resistor to VCC (e.g. to CN7 - pin 7).
2. Connect the anode of a Schottky diode (e.g. BAT42) to CN10 - pin 6 (PA3).
3. Connect the cathode of the Schottky diode to CN10 - pin 18 (PA2). 
   <br> Connect the other side of the 1k0 resistor to this pin as well.

### Maximum baud rates
The maximum data transfer rate depends on
* The embedded system peripherals and their clock rates.
* The serial port used to transfer data to the host and its clock rate (in this example, the VCP peripheral in the on-board ST-LINK).
* Characteristics and length of the connection (e.g. cable) between the two serial ports, etc.
* And also the clock speed of the processor and the quality of the driver implementation for the serial channel - how many CPU cycles it takes to send and receive a single character. Transferring data to the host should not overload the CPU core, as this would interfere too much with the execution of the application in the embedded system.

On the NUCLEO-C071, the tested processor (STM32C071) and the processor implementing the ST-LINK v2 and USB VCP serial links are very close to each other. The transmission speed for two-wire communication is only limited by the maximum baud rate value that can be set for both serial interfaces, given the limitations of the serial peripherals and their clocks and prescalers. The maximum value that can be achieved is 1500 kbps. Correct speeds are also 1000 kbps, 600 kbps, 115200 bps, etc.

For single wire communication, the speeds are generally lower and depend mainly on the value of the pull-up resistor and the total capacitance (it depends mainly on the type and length of the cable). The minimum value of the pull-up resistor depends mainly on how much current the output MOSFET TxD pin of the processor can sink. In the case of the NUCLEO-C071RB conversion, a 1k00 pull-up resistor was used and the connections were very short. The maximum speed tested was 1500 kbps.

Very high baud rates are usually not useful for real-time projects because interrupts to receive messages from the host take CPU time away from the application under test. This is especially true for single-wire (half-duplex) communication, where each transmission to the host also triggers an interrupt because the serial peripheral receives what it sends. One solution to reduce the processor load at high communication speeds with single-wire communication would be to process the data received from the interrupt with a DMA unit.

To achieve faster transfer execution and less impact on the tested application, at least for the serial channel transfer functions, enable a higher level of compiler optimization and use optimized low-level code in the serial channel interrupt program to receive data from the host.

## Meaning of Repository Tags

|Tag|Description|
|:---:|:-----------|
| **v0.99** | The code generated using HAL LL (Low Level) drivers as a basis to demonstrate RTEcomLib functions for transferring data from an embedded system with limited resources. Several unnecessary files have been deleted from the `Drivers\CMSIS\Include` folder. |
| **v1.00** | Added RTEcomLib code for serial data transfer to host, RTEdbg data logging and test code. |

Compare v0.99 and v.100 using e.g. WinMerge to see what has been done to integrate the RTEcomLib serial communication library and the RTElib data logging library.

## Notes on the STM32C071 Demo Project
The code of this project is intended to demonstrate functions for transferring logged and other data from the embedded system. The functions for transferring data over the serial channel are located in the file *RTEcomLib/rte_com*.c. The *RTEcomLib* folder also contains header files and a DMA driver for the STM32 processor family. The definitions of the various constants needed to compile the data transfer functions are located in the file *Core/Inc/main.h*.

The demo project code was generated using the STM32CubeMX. LL (Low Level Drivers) instead of the standard HAL was enabled for all peripheral drivers in "Project Manager => Advanced Options". The generated initialization code is far from what the author considers low level. This code has not been optimized for generality, only the code in the RTEcomLib folder has been optimized. For your project, you will have to optimize the initialization code by hand and remove anything unnecessary if you have problems with Flash memory space.
